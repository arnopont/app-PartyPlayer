# a2a-stub

## Dependencies

a2a-stub requires node-websocket and log4js. Install by entering

  npm install websocket log4js

Also you need a browser that actually has websocket support and has it turned on too.

## Usage

1. Fire up the server: `node server.js`
2. Open `test/client.html` in your browser

Have fun!
