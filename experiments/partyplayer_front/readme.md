## partyplayer_front

this folder is an expiremental folder containing small bits and pieces of the partyplayer app.

In the JS folder are a few test js files showing some javascript patterns, these are:

1. testpseudoclassical.js
2. functionalpattern.js

The canvas folder holds a small test using the html5 canvas draw element.

* create_collection.js
* screenshot.js

These files are stub files to fake the data I would be getting for the frontend.

The collection.html file contains the basic html and loads the javascript files.

Current status of this experiment can be loaded using main.js and initialize.js<br/>
functionalities:

* load collection
* add partyitem to playlist
* integrated youtube API
* able to play youtube movies
* when youtube is done, load next item in playlist

Currently work in progress:

* funnel functionality
* manipulate items, add/remove

Many files are outdated and are simple tests of coding
